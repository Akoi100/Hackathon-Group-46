# SkillUp Safe 🛡️

A mobile-first, gamified educational platform designed to empower vulnerable communities in Africa with essential digital literacy and safety skills.

## 🎯 The Problem

Many digital literacy resources are generic, not engaging, and fail to address the specific, culturally-relevant threats faced by women, girls, and other vulnerable groups online. This gap leaves them exposed to digital violence, scams, and privacy violations.

## 💡 Our Solution

**SkillUp Safe** transforms digital safety education from a boring lecture into an engaging adventure. We use interactive games, quizzes, and role-playing scenarios set in a relatable "Digital Village" to teach users how to:

*   🎣 Spot phishing scams and fake offers.
*   🔒 Manage privacy settings on social media.
*   🚷 Recognize and respond to online grooming and harassment.
*   📢 Identify misinformation and fake news.
*   💬 Practice safe and respectful online communication.

By making learning fun and accessible, we empower users to navigate the digital world with confidence.

## ✨ Unique Value Proposition

*   **Gamified Learning:** Interactive modules and a reward system (badges, points, avatar customization) boost engagement and knowledge retention.
*   **Culturally Tailored:** Content is specifically designed for diverse African communities, addressing local platforms, common scam tactics, and social contexts.
*   **User-Centric Design:** A focus on the unique threats faced by women and girls, with inclusive design for all users.
*   **Proactive Prevention:** Shifts the focus from reacting to harm to proactively building digital resilience.

## 🎮 Core Features
